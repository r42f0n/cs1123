Assessment 1 brief: Data visualisation exercise
(Individual: 25%)
Introduction
This assessment aims to enhance your data analysis and presentation skills, setting the foundation for mapping tasks in Assessment 2. While this assignment primarily focuses on accessing data and core data analysis and presentation elements, it aims to provide you with a meaningful understanding of data-driven decision-making processes.
For this assessment, you will engage in a comprehensive analysis of a chosen Local Authority's profile using data obtained from NOMIS. This assessment is aimed at developing your data literacy skills. The principal output you are working towards is the production of a commentary   containing a series of data presentation methods and associated commentary.
Objectives
This assessment is designed to develop and test, in particular, your achievement of the following module objectives:
·   Objective 1: Retrieve data from public sources for use in social science 
·   Objective 3: Describe and summarise secondary data using descriptive statistics
·   Objective 5: Visualise and critically interpret secondary data
The Task
Your task is to create a written summary comparing the composition of the Middle Super Output Areas of a chosen Local Authority to that of Sheffield. This analysis should leverage data analysis and visualisation techniques acquired through workshops 1 and 2. Your report should be centred around one   of the following census tables:·   TS061 Method of travel to work,·   TS030 Religion, OR   ·   TS054 Tenure.
Your report should provide a comparison between Sheffield and a Local Authority chosen from the list below: ·   Leeds·   Nottingham·   Bradford·   York
For your chosen variable, you should present a written summary of the profile for your chosen Local Authority, illustrated with a combination of Tables and Charts using summary statistics where necessary (you are not   expected to create maps for this assessment). Part of your assignment is to sift through the data to identify meaningful ways to summarise and present it. This means that you may decide to exclude - or group - some aspects of the data.
Your data should be sourced from NOMIS following the instructions in workshop 1 but note that you will need to choose the appropriate Topic Summary table. This means that the options you need 代 写TRP 216 Urban analytics Assessment 1 brief: Data visualisation exercise

Remember to look at the metadata for the relevant Topic Summary, this contains important information on how to interpret your variable.Key Components:Your report should encompass the following key components:·   A written summary of your chosen Local Authority's profile.·   Effective utilization of Tables and Charts, including summary statistics where applicable, to illustrate your findings.·   A thoughtful consideration of associated metadata.·   Critical commentary on the interpretation of your analysis.·   A brief exploration of the implications of your results within a planning context.
Your analysis should be insightful and reflective of your data interpretation skills, including the key steps such as data selection, data preparation and exploration, data analysis and visualisation, interpretation and commentary, and report presentation with clarity and professionalism. Some guidance is given below:
Assignment Information
Explanation
“written report”
This means that your report should be handed in as a document written on a computer. It can be helpful to divide it into sections with sub-headings (e.g. Introduction, Conclusion).
“500 word”
The report should be 500 words (+/- 10%). The range is therefore 450 to 550 words. If it’s shorter than this, you will have to say a little more. If it’s longer than this, you’ll have to cut it down.
Font size, type, etc.
You can use any font you like, so long as it is easy to read and a minimum of size 12. 
Paper size
You submit your work electronically but try to use A4 portrait   size as a standard setting. 
Use of images and charts
In academic work, images include charts, maps and photos. They should be labelled as a Figure and should be numbered consecutively (e.g. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) and referred to in the text. You should give the figure a caption that gives some indication of the content and acknowledges the source (this is very important).
Use of tables
The use of tables can also be effective. If you use a table, make sure it is referred to in the text and labelled correctly (e.g. Table 1, Table 2, Table 3).
You should give the table a caption that gives some indication of the content.   As with images, always acknowledge the data source within the caption.
